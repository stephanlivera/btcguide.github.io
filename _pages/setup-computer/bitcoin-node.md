title: Configure Bitcoin Node
---

Think of your bitcoin node as a fake bitcoin detector, it will confirm that bitcoin's consensus rules are being followed so that when you receive a payment you can validate that you are getting real bitcoins. It will also help with fee estimation, coin selection, and generating transactions.

Keep in mind that while a malicious full node can try to deceive you, it does not have access to your private keys.

Recommended options for setting up your Bitcoin Node are [RaspiBlitz](https://shop.fulmo.org/raspiblitz/), [Nodl](https://www.nodl.it/), and [MyNode](https://mynodebtc.com/) Premium Edition. They all have Specter packaged. Note RaspiBlitz is free, Nodl and myNode Premium are paid products. 

Alternatively you can install Specter on your desktop or laptop PC alongside Bitcoin Core. 

[TODO]: find 1-click cloud deploy node?

#### Required Configuration
In order for [Specter-Desktop](/install-specter) to connect to this full node, you'll need to set `server=1` in your `bitcoin.conf` file.

You'll also need a way to authenticate a connection to your node.
If your node is run on the same computer as Specter, Specter will likely be able to automatically detect authentication info from a `.cookie` file that bitcoin core created on your computer.
If this node is run on a different computer (a "remote" machine), you'll need to know the `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword` that your bitcoin core node is using.
We recommend setting `rpcuser` to `specter` (if you can) for simplicity.

#### HWI Bridge
Note that for physically connecting hardware wallets using your laptop/desktop with Specter packaged on another device e.g. myNode, RaspiBlitz or nodl, you may need to set up [HWI Bridge](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop/blob/master/docs/hwibridge.md). 

#### Optional Configuration
If you can tweak your settings, we recommend the following (optional):
* Do **not** run your node in [pruning mode](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#reduce-storage) as this disables `rescan` functionality.
In some edge cases you may need to rescan your node, and a pruned node will instead have to (automatically) `reindex` the whole blockchain (can take many hours to many days).
* Set [`blockfilterindex=1`](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.19.0.1).
It takes just a few GB of storage and helps speedup blockchain `rescan`ing.
